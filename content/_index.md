My name is Alfons Mu√±oz, I'm a computer engineer from Spain, currently living in Mexico. 

I'm passionate about Cloud Technology and DevOps culture. In particular I'm interested in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and google implementation of DevOps and SRE. I'm 3x Google Certified Professional, [Thanks a Cloud Guru! ;-)](https://learn.acloud.guru/profile/alfonsmr), and founder of [aristaequis](http://www.aristaequis.com) a Google Cloud Partner in Mexico. I'm also the Latin America Community Manager at [C2C Global](https://bit.ly/3AJLbrI), "The Independent Google Cloud Community".
