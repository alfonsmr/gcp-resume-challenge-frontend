In this project we are going to build a personal brand website on GCP with an API backend and Gitops-based CI/CD. We will be able to monitor our entire project with Google Cloud Operations.

In this project you will gain experience with many skills, including coding, storage, compute, networking, source control, CI/CD, Serverless architecture, GitOps, and technical communication.

This project is my personal implementation of the challenge that A Mattias Andersson from a Cloud Guru launched on August 2021.

Look at original ["Your resume on GCP"](https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/cloudguruchallenge-your-resume-on-gcp) challenge instrucctions before looking at this repo code to have a real challenge yourself.

This repository holds the README file for the whole project and the frontend code. The repository for the Backend can be found at https://github.com/alfonsmr/gcp-resume-challenge-backend

The rpository for the GitOps-based CI/CD is stored privately in the backend GCP Project.

### The Author

My name is Alfons Muñoz, I'm a computer engineer from Spain, now living in Mexico. I'm passionate about Cloud Technology and DevOps culture. In particular I'm interested in Google CLoud Platform (GCP) and google implementation of DevOps and SRE. I'm 3x Google Certified Professional and founder of [aristaequis]() a Google Cloud Partner in Mexico. I'm also the Latin America Community Manager for [C2C Global](https://bit.ly/3AJLbrI), "The Independent Google Cloud Community".

Be sure to visit the [C2C Community](https://bit.ly/3AJLbrI) and drop me a message or start a new topic if you want to continue the conversation about this project.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

You can follow the explanaitons here to make the project, do not clone the project as it is my own implementation of the challenge. You will need to prepare your own implementation

### Prerequisites

You can use your own GCP account. If you don't have one you can set-up a trial one with access to a free tier and $300 in credit. [Free Trial and Free Tier.](https://cloud.google.com/free)

You will also need some code editor like VS Code and a Github account.

### Installation

You can do almost all the job from inside Google Cloud Shell Console and edit files with Cloud Shell Editor.

For the frontend it's recommended to install Hugo in your computer.

## The Project

### The Frontend

The frontend is developed using [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/), Hugo is a general-purpose website framework. Technically speaking, Hugo is a static site generator. Unlike systems that dynamically build a page with each visitor request, Hugo builds pages when you create or update your content.
In technical terms, Hugo takes a source directory of files and templates and uses these as input to create a complete website.

I used [Ghostwriter](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/ghostwriter/) a Hugo template created by [Juraj Bubniak](https://github.com/jbub) as the starting point for my website.

The website consist of main page at (https://gcp-resume-challenge.alfonsmr.com/), this will be the "Personal brand" webpage and will contain:
* My name and a Linkedin profile
* a link to my GCP Certifications 
* A Link to my profile at A Cloud Guru
* A visitor counter, using our backend to store and retrieve the counter.
* A subpage with a description of the challenge/project

#### The development proccess

The website is developed locally using VS Code and the changes are pushed to a github repository. You can use the "hugo" command to build and see the website but we are not going to push the "public" directory into the repository. we are going to build and publish the website with Google Cloud Build.

We don't need to modify any of the Go templates because we are doing minor changes or adding content using only html, css and JS.

In the main index.html page we include a JQuery Javascript that calls our backend, retrieves the counter value and displays it on the webpage. 

We also add the static content for the main page and the description of the project in a subpage of the site. 

#### Hosting the Site

We will put our final files in a Google Cloud Storage bucket, well, CloudBuild will do that, but we need to prepare the bucket.
Not all buckets can serve static files as webpages, so be sure to follow the following documentation to set up all the correct parameters.

[Hosting a static website](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hosting-static-website)
[Static website examples and tips](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/static-website)

Name your bucket exactly as the url you are going to call later. e.g if your domain is "www.example.com" your bucket should be named "www.example.com"

#### Using your own domain

I used a domain I own, if you don't have one you can get one with Google at [Cloud Domains](https://cloud.google.com/domains).

As I have one already I just point my name servers to google and I can start using [Cloud DNS](https://cloud.google.com/dns) to manage it.

You will point your desired record name to the load balancer you are creating in later steps.

We are using a load balancer to get HTTPS over our bucket files.

You can later add here easy to manage names for acces the backend also, like api.mydomain.com

#### Using HTTPS

We are setting up a load balancer, which final destination will be our bucket.

Follow the following document to set up the load balancer and the bucket backend.

* [Setting up a load balancer with backend buckets](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https/ext-load-balancer-backend-buckets)

#### Using Cloud CDN

To server content closer to the user requesting it and have a cache we will use [Cloud CDN](https://cloud.google.com/cdn/docs/overview)

To enable Cloud CDN for our HTTPS Load Balancer see the following documentation:

* [Setting up Cloud CDN with a backend bucket](https://cloud.google.com/cdn/docs/setting-up-cdn-with-bucket)

#### The CI/CD process for the frontend

Now that we have everything in place we will setup a CloudBuild action that builds and publishes our site everytinme we change our webpage and push the changes to Github. CloudBuild will be also repsonsible to invalidate the CDN cache every time it runs so we can be sure users are seeing our most recent changes.

Cloudbuild will:

* Download Hugo executable and build our website from our Github files
* Copy the built website into the GCS Bucket
* Invvalidate the cache

You can follow this documentation to see how Cloubuild works:

* [Overview of Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/overview)

You can see the cloudbuild.yaml file in this repository to see exactly which steps cloudbuild is doing and how.

### The Backend

#### The Cloud Run API

#### The Firestore Database

#### Store the code in Github

#### Using Cloud Source Repositories (CSR)

#### Using Cloud Build with Cloud Source Repositories (CSR)

#### The CI/CD process for the frontend

### All Together

## Roadmap

Things missing in the project due to time constraints that I would like to implement in the future

* Add test ciode for the frontend
* Improve the test code for the backend
* Add terraform Iac to be able to create the project from scratch
* Define and add an SLO for the backend
* Merge the forntend and backend into a single repo
* Use environment variables and git branches to be able to deploy to dev staging and prod environments on demmand.
* Make a step-by-step guide to implement the project

See the [open issues](https://github.com/alfonsmr/gcp-resume-challenge-frontend/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
